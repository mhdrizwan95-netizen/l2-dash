# North Star

Mission: Build a trading application that is privacy-first, deterministic, and agent-assisted.

Principles:
- Determinism over drama: predictable state, no surprises
- Privacy guard: no secrets ever committed
- Agents do code, humans do clarity
- One change at a time, traceable

Non-Goals:
- No vendor lock-in
- No "just works" magic without traceability

Core Loop:
Data ingest → Signal generation → Risk checks → Orders → Audit → Review

KPIs:
- Mean lead time per ticket
- Stability (0 black-screen defects)
- Test coverage on core loops

Review cadence: Weekly (Thu 17:00 Asia/Riyadh)
